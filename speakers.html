    <h2>Designing a Culture of Design</h2>
        <p>Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it<br> doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior,<br> beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what stifles a <br>workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need <br>to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.</br>

    <br>In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that<br> *get* design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and<br> companies have that others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your<br> own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost<br> impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.</br></p>
